d tasks are two types of computational workloads that have different characteristics and resource requirements. Let's explore each type and provide examples:

1. **I/O-Bound Tasks**:
   I/O-bound tasks are tasks that spend a significant amount of time waiting for input/output operations to complete, such as reading from or writing to files, network communication, database queries, and more. These tasks tend to be limited by the speed of external resources (like disks, networks, or databases) rather than the processing power of the CPU.

   **Example**:
   Consider a web server handling incoming HTTP requests. The server needs to read data from the network, process the request, potentially perform database queries, and then send a response back to the client. The time spent waiting for network and database I/O operations dominates the processing time.

2. **CPU-Bound Tasks**:
   CPU-bound tasks are tasks that consume a lot of CPU resources and processing power. These tasks involve complex calculations, data processing, or algorithms that require substantial computational resources. CPU-bound tasks are constrained by the processing capacity of the CPU and may not benefit significantly from parallelism if they cannot be divided into smaller independent chunks.

   **Example**:
   Cryptographic operations like encryption and decryption involve complex mathematical calculations that can be resource-intensive. For instance, if you are encrypting a large amount of data, the CPU's processing power becomes the limiting factor as it performs intricate calculations.

It's important to note that the distinction between I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks isn't always clear-cut, and tasks can sometimes exhibit characteristics of both types. For example, image processing that involves reading image data from disk, applying complex filters (CPU-bound), and then writing the processed image back to disk could be a mix of I/O-bound and CPU-bound aspects.

When designing or optimizing systems, understanding whether a task is I/O-bound or CPU-bound can help in selecting appropriate strategies and resources. For I/O-bound tasks, optimizing I/O operations and handling asynchronous tasks efficiently can improve performance. For CPU-bound tasks, leveraging multi-threading or parallel processing can help make use of available CPU cores effectively.
