A **Hot Publisher** in Project Reactor is a publisher that emits data regardless of whether there are active subscribers. This means that if a subscriber subscribes to a hot publisher after data has started being emitted, the subscriber might miss some of the earlier emitted data. Hot publishers are used to broadcast data to multiple subscribers without restarting the sequence for each subscriber.

The `ConnectableFlux` class in Project Reactor allows you to create hot publishers and control when the data emission starts.

Here's an example of how to create and use a hot publisher using `ConnectableFlux`:

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.ConnectableFlux;
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
import reactor.core.scheduler.Schedulers;

public class HotPublisherExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a cold publisher
        Flux<Integer> coldPublisher = Flux.range(1, 10)
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.parallel());

        // Create a hot publisher using ConnectableFlux
        ConnectableFlux<Integer> hotPublisher = coldPublisher.publish();

        // Start emitting data to subscribers
        hotPublisher.connect();

        // Subscriber 1 subscribes after data has started emitting
        hotPublisher.subscribe(item -> System.out.println("Subscriber 1: " + item));

        // Sleep for a while to allow data emission
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // Subscriber 2 subscribes after data has started emitting
        hotPublisher.subscribe(item -> System.out.println("Subscriber 2: " + item));
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. We create a cold publisher (`coldPublisher`) using `Flux.range(1, 10)`. This publisher emits integers from 1 to 10.

2. We create a hot publisher (`hotPublisher`) using the `publish()` method on the cold publisher. The `hotPublisher` is a `ConnectableFlux` instance.

3. We call `hotPublisher.connect()` to start emitting data to subscribers. At this point, any subscribers that subscribe will receive data.

4. We subscribe `Subscriber 1` to the `hotPublisher`. Since `hotPublisher` is already emitting data, `Subscriber 1` will receive data from the point it subscribes.

5. We introduce a delay using `Thread.sleep()` to allow data emission to continue.

6. After the delay, we subscribe `Subscriber 2` to the `hotPublisher`. `Subscriber 2` will start receiving data from the point it subscribes, potentially missing data that was emitted earlier.

**Relevancy and Use Cases**:

Hot publishers are useful when you want to provide real-time updates to multiple subscribers without restarting the sequence for each subscriber. Use cases include real-time event broadcasting, sensor data transmission, and scenarios where you want to keep subscribers up to date with live data. It's important to note that hot publishers can lead to data loss if subscribers join late. Therefore, they are more suitable for scenarios where missing some data is acceptable or can be managed.
