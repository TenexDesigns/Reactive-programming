In Project Reactor, the `retry` and `retryWhen` operators are used to handle errors by attempting to resubscribe to the source `Flux` or `Mono` when an error occurs. These operators are helpful for scenarios where transient errors might occur and you want to give the system a chance to recover by retrying the operation.

Let's explore how these operators work and provide some code samples:

1. **`retry` Operator**:
   The `retry` operator automatically resubscribes to the source `Flux` or `Mono` when an error occurs. It has an overload that allows you to specify the maximum number of retry attempts.

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
import reactor.util.retry.Retry;

public class RetryOperatorExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flux<Integer> flux = Flux.range(1, 5)
                .map(i -> {
                    if (i == 3) {
                        throw new RuntimeException("Error");
                    }
                    return i;
                })
                .retry(2); // Retry up to 2 times

        flux.subscribe(
                item -> System.out.println("Received: " + item),
                error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error)
        );
    }
}
```

In this example, the `retry` operator is used with a maximum retry count of 2. If an error occurs (for instance, when `i` is 3), the `retry` operator will resubscribe to the `Flux` up to two times.

2. **`retryWhen` Operator**:
   The `retryWhen` operator gives you more control over when to retry by allowing you to specify a function that returns a `Mono`. The `Mono` emits a value when you want to retry and completes if you don't want to retry.

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
import reactor.util.retry.Retry;
import reactor.util.function.Tuple2;
import reactor.util.function.Tuples;

import java.time.Duration;

public class RetryWhenOperatorExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flux<Integer> flux = Flux.range(1, 5)
                .map(i -> {
                    if (i == 3) {
                        throw new RuntimeException("Error");
                    }
                    return i;
                })
                .retryWhen(Retry.fixedDelay(2, Duration.ofSeconds(1)));

        flux.subscribe(
                item -> System.out.println("Received: " + item),
                error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error)
        );
    }
}
```

In this example, the `retryWhen` operator uses the `Retry.fixedDelay` strategy, which retries the subscription after a fixed delay (in this case, 1 second) up to the specified number of times (2 times).

**Relevance and Use Cases**:

- These operators are useful when dealing with transient errors that might occur due to temporary network issues or resource unavailability.
- They can be used in scenarios where it's reasonable to retry the operation before giving up, allowing the system to recover from intermittent failures.
- The choice of whether to use `retry` or `retryWhen` depends on how much control you need over the retry behavior.

Remember that excessive retrying can lead to performance issues and increased load on external resources. It's important to set appropriate retry limits and delays based on the characteristics of the error and the system's requirements.
