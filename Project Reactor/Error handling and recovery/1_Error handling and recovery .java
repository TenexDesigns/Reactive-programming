Error handling and recovery are critical aspects of reactive programming in Project Reactor, as they ensure that your application can gracefully handle errors and failures while maintaining its responsiveness and stability. Error handling is used to manage exceptions that might occur during the processing of data streams and provides mechanisms to recover from those errors.

Here's how error handling and recovery work in Project Reactor and where and when they are used:

**1. Handling Errors with Operators**:
Project Reactor provides various operators to handle errors and exceptions in reactive pipelines. Some of the commonly used operators for error handling include:

- `onErrorResume`: This operator allows you to provide a fallback publisher that emits data in case an error occurs.
- `onErrorReturn`: Emits a fallback value when an error occurs.
- `onErrorMap`: Transforms an error by applying a function to it.
- `retry`: Retries subscribing to the source publisher when an error occurs, up to a specified number of times.

**2. Recovery Strategies**:
Error recovery strategies depend on the nature of your application. Some common strategies include:
- Providing default values when an error occurs.
- Falling back to cached or previously retrieved data.
- Logging errors for analysis and debugging.

**3. Reactive Error Handling in Code**:
Here's a simple code example that demonstrates error handling and recovery:

```java
import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public class ErrorHandlingExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Flux<Integer> flux = Flux.range(1, 5)
                .map(i -> {
                    if (i == 3) {
                        throw new RuntimeException("Error at " + i);
                    }
                    return i;
                })
                .onErrorResume(ex -> {
                    System.out.println("Error occurred: " + ex.getMessage());
                    return Flux.just(0, 0, 0); // Recovery with default values
                });

        flux.subscribe(
                item -> System.out.println("Processed: " + item),
                ex -> System.err.println("Subscriber Error: " + ex.getMessage())
        );
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `map` operator throws an exception when `i` is 3.
- The `onErrorResume` operator is used to handle the error by emitting a fallback Flux with default values (0, 0, 0).

**4. Relevancy**:
- **Stability and Reliability**: Proper error handling ensures that your application doesn't crash due to unexpected exceptions. It enhances the stability and reliability of your reactive application.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Error recovery strategies help your application gracefully degrade in the face of errors, ensuring that users still receive responses, even if some data processing fails.
- **Logging and Debugging**: Error handling provides a way to log errors, making it easier to debug and fix issues.

In summary, error handling and recovery mechanisms in Project Reactor are essential for building robust, reliable, and responsive reactive applications. They help your application handle exceptions gracefully and provide strategies to recover from errors while maintaining the integrity of your data streams.
