In the context of scheduling in Project Reactor, scheduling is done by specifying which scheduler should be used for different parts of the reactive pipeline. Project Reactor provides various methods that allow you to assign specific schedulers to different operations within your reactive stream. This allows you to control where and when tasks are executed, manage concurrency, parallelism, and responsiveness in your reactive applications.

The key methods used for scheduling in Project Reactor are:

1. **`subscribeOn` Method**: This method specifies the scheduler to be used for subscribing to the source publisher. It affects the entire upstream part of the reactive pipeline, including data emission from the source.
   ```java
   Flux<Integer> flux = Flux.range(1, 10);
   flux.subscribeOn(Schedulers.parallel());
   ```

2. **`publishOn` Method**: This method specifies the scheduler to be used for the subsequent operations in the pipeline. It affects the downstream part of the reactive pipeline.
   ```java
   Flux<Integer> flux = Flux.range(1, 10);
   flux.publishOn(Schedulers.single());
   ```

3. **`doOnNext`, `map`, and Other Operators**: These operators also accept a scheduler as an argument, allowing you to specify on which scheduler the operation should be executed.
   ```java
   Flux<Integer> flux = Flux.range(1, 10);
   flux
       .map(i -> i * 2)
       .doOnNext(i -> System.out.println("Processed: " + i))
       .subscribeOn(Schedulers.parallel())
       .publishOn(Schedulers.single())
       .subscribe();
   ```

4. **Schedulers**: Project Reactor provides various built-in schedulers in the `Schedulers` class. You can choose from schedulers like `Schedulers.immediate()`, `Schedulers.single()`, `Schedulers.parallel()`, `Schedulers.elastic()`, etc.

By using these methods and built-in schedulers, you can control the execution context and thread usage in your reactive application. Depending on where you place the `subscribeOn` and `publishOn` methods, as well as which scheduler you use for individual operators, you can manage how tasks are executed, where parallelism is introduced, and how data flows through your reactive pipeline.

Remember that each scheduling operation creates a new context for execution. It's essential to carefully choose the appropriate scheduling strategy based on the characteristics of the tasks, the desired concurrency level, and the specific requirements of your application.
